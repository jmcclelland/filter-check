# Filter Check

This program helps you determine if mail sent by your email server is landing in the spam or junk folder of the major email providers.

It will send email via any service you have configured and check email via any service you have configured and report if the message was received and if so, if it landed in the inbox or spam folder.

## Notes

For gmail to work, you have to configure your account to allow logins from "less secure apps" (see https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en). I have no idea what that means, but you can't login to gmail via this program with that setting enabled.
